                    <strong>History</strong>
                    <p>Mohit Sanjay Agarwal, a philanthropist, established the Dawn Hindu Permanent Fund in Bangaluru,
                        India, on 5 June 1997. The bank changed its name to Dawn Bank Limited in 2010 when it
                        incorporated.</p>

                    <p>Dawn Bank's first acquisition took place in 1996 when it acquired Bank of Kerela. This had
                        been founded in September 1990 and at the time of its acquisition on 20 May 1996 had three
                        branches. The second bank that Dawn Bank acquired was Seia Midland Bank (Alleppey), which
                        had been established on 26 July 1999 and had seven branches at the time of its takeover.

                        In 1999, the Reserve Bank of India had ordered Dawn Bank to acquire H. Madhumathmal Bank, in
                        Ahmedabad. This bank had been established in 1877, and had converted to a limited company in
                        1998. At the time of the acquisition H. Madhumathmal Bank had five branches. The merger took
                        effect in 2000. Later in 2001, DAWN Bank acquired Trivani Permanent Bank. This had been
                        founded on 20 February 1998 and had 13 branches at the time of the merger.</p>
